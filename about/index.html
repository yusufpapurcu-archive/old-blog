<h3 id=a-programmer-side-of-myself>A programmer side of myself</h3>
<p>I am developing softwares nearly 6 years and I am doing this as my main job in last two years. I&rsquo;m working at <a href=https://www.virtualmetric.com/>VirtualMetric</a> as a software developer. I&rsquo;m using Go as my main programming language in work. Also we are working about monitoring, so I am able to work with different operating systems and infrastructures. I don&rsquo;t have any problem about them thanks to my work :/</p>
<p>I love designing programs for my real life problems. And sometimes I&rsquo;m share them in <a href=https://github.com/yusufpapurcu>my GitHub</a>. Check <a href=https://github.com/thatmightgood>That Might Good</a> org. It&rsquo;s my archive for this kind repositories.</p>
<h3 id=my-small-hobies-and-habits>My small hobies and habits</h3>
<p>I love reading books. Currently I am reading 3 books at the same time. All of them has another subject and contains different stories. Usually I read 2 books at the same time. First one is a novel that I am interested in. Second one is a books which can be readen in parts. My reading habit is doesn&rsquo;t have any logic. I can end 500+ page novel in 1 day. Sometimes I just read over and over same book. This book is usually is &ldquo;Homo Sapiens&rdquo; or &ldquo;Homo Deus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also I like learning new languages. Recently I am learning Japanese for fun. Until I am bored from animes I will continue this learning process :)</p>
<p>I kinda like playing video games. I started playing different games recently and I will share my ideas about them in this blog.</p>
