## Hello Everybody ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Yusuf Turhan Papurcu (yusufpapurcu)**. 

I am sharing my ideas in here. There is no limitation in post contents. You can see my interests below. This will give you idea about what you will found in this blog.

### A programmer side of myself
I am developing softwares nearly 6 years and I am doing this as my main job in last two years. I'm working at [VirtualMetric](https://www.virtualmetric.com/) as a software developer. I'm using Go as my main programming language in work. Also we are working about monitoring, so I am able to work with different operating systems and infrastructures. I don't have any problem about them thanks to my work :/

I love designing programs for my real life problems. And sometimes I'm share them in [my GitHub](https://github.com/yusufpapurcu). Check [That Might Good](https://github.com/thatmightgood) org. It's my archive for this kind repositories.

### My small hobies and habits
I love reading books. Currently I am reading 3 books at the same time. All of them has another subject and contains different stories. Usually I read 2 books at the same time. First one is a novel that I am interested in. Second one is a books which can be readen in parts. My reading habit is doesn't have any logic. I can end 500+ page novel in 1 day. Sometimes I just read over and over same book. This book is usually is "Homo Sapiens" or "Homo Deus".

Also I like learning new languages. Recently I am learning Japanese for fun. Until I am bored from animes I will continue this learning process :)

I kinda like playing video games. I started playing different games recently and I will share my ideas about them in this blog.
