## Self Development

---

I was reading ton about philosophy but my mind quite blurry. I worry about future, but not in a bad way. I just have a lot of options but I don't know what to do about it.

As a SWE I improved a lot this year. I switched to a bigger company and started working in a more organized place with lot's of amazing people. I really enjoy being a software engineer!

## What is my goal(s) in 2023?

---

I will mention my OKR's here:

- Travel to 5 countries in Europe within the next year.
- Promote to Senior Software Engineer within the next year.
- Increase the subscribers and watch time on my YouTube channel by 150% within the next year.
- Incorporate calisthenics into my daily routine within the next year.

I tried to be more precise this year. I am not that much hyped for new year like last one :/

## Some topics for new year
I listed some important topics for me while ending the year.

### 1. Being more focused and passionate

---

I put this topic as first because it was the biggest tortue that I carried whole year. Even now I am getting distracted by lot's of stuff.

To be honest, I don't have any solutions except blocking social media to avoid distractions :/

### 2. Getting along with money better

---

I'm still young and I feel like I don't know money enough. Even I made ~1k$ from stock market I need to improve myself on this topic.

### 3. Making memories persistent

---

Human memory is just like iPhone X with 64GB storage. Capacity is low espacially in short term, and I feel this in every moment.

Writing, taking photos or videos. I need to do them more.

### What I did about learning language?

---

Here we are, consistent topic of every year, maybe life. I move my focus into Portugese and keep English/Japanese just in same place.

#### English

I made great achivement. Espacially in spoken english.

#### Japonca

I just took some courses and learned reading (Hiragana/Katakana), some daily conversations but thats all. Main issue is not finding anyone to speak tbh. It breaks motivation as well.

#### Portugese

So here we are, new final boss. I am not interested in language or culture tbh. But I need Portugese to live in Portugal. Simple, isn't it? Also It's makes easy to learn Spanish and Italian.

I don't know anything now, but I want to be able to speak Portugese until 2024.

## Gaming

---

- **League of Legends**: Classic, Hell. I didn't played since last month. I'm just watching Zeitnot.
- **Minecraft**/**World of Tanks**: Fun to spend some time on it, I'm glad I didn't spent too much.
- **Rainbow Six Siege**: Not bad while playing with friends, I didn't played by myself at all.
