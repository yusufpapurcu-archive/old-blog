I found [CARRION]() in Nintendo Switch commercials. After that I searched about a bit and bought from steam. It was an interesting game while searching but after playing it I can say that was so good.

### What is [CARRION]()?

[CARRION]() is a reverse horror game in which you assume the role of an amorphous creature of unknown origins, stalking and consuming those that imprisoned you.
[CARRION]() is a horror video game developed by Phobia Game Studio and published by Devolver Digital.

### My setup for gaming
I played it in M1 Mac without any problem. Game works flawlessly in M1 chip. Also I played with keyboard + mause. Maybe game controller experience better than keyboard+mause duo.

### Controller experience
I think this movement control style realllly good. I didn't played anything like this before. It gives you a nice gameplay while hunting and solving puzzles.
