Lately I am consuming a lot of content about gaming industry and game development processes. And this book is one of my enterence point. After reading some chapters I started to thinking about manipulate my career to gaming industry.

This book has a lot of story inside. It contains 10 different game development story. And we see success stories, one man games, studios that declared independence and went bankrupt and so more. In the end of the book I can just say "Where is the continue?". 

I loved the way books express stories. Every story splitted in chapters. And you can read them individually. That makes this book a good for short reading sessions. Like I can read this book in my free classes and I can stop reading without any problem.

And let's come to the point. I think I can switch my job because of this book. That's because I liked the way of development in gaming industry. They rushing all in one and release the game. After that your workload is decreasing and you be able to go vacations without any problems. Also you will be in interaction with your players in some companies and that makes this industry even better. I think this can be a short term hype but I love being hyped. Maybe I can try some game development things in my free times.
