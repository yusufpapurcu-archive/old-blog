Lately I am consuming a lot of content about gaming industry and game development processes. And this book is one of my enterence point. After reading some chapters I dragged into this kind of stories.

In this book there is 10 different stories shows us how to make games. In Obsidian Studios part we will see how crowd funding makes studios independent from giant publishers. In another part we will to be witness a great story of Eric Barone. He will create mountains (not really mountains actually it is [Stardew Valley]()) without any team as a indie developer. And we will read about Star Wars 1313 frustration as final boss.
- Pillars of Eternity 
- Uncharted 4 
- Stardew Valley
- Diablo III
- Halo Wars
- Dragon Age: Inquisition
- Shovel Knight
- Destiny
- The Witcher 3
- Star Wars 1313.

I loved the way books express stories. Every story splitted in chapters. And you can read them individually. That makes this book a good for short reading sessions. Like I can read this book in my free classes and I can stop reading without any problem.

And let's come to the point. This is a great game for newcomers in gaming stories. It gives you a nice examples from AAA studios to indie developers. It contains success stories, frustrations, studio collapses and rises. I suggest you to read this book.
