Lately I am consuming a lot of content about gaming industry and game development processes. And this book is one of my enterence point. After reading some chapters I dragged into this kind of stories.

This book has a lot of story inside. It contains 10 different game development story.
- Pillars of Eternity 
- Uncharted 4 
- Stardew Valley
- Diablo III
- Halo Wars
- Dragon Age: Inquisition
- Shovel Knight
- Destiny
- The Witcher 3
- Star Wars 1313.

I loved the way books express stories. Every story splitted in chapters. And you can read them individually. That makes this book a good for short reading sessions. Like I can read this book in my free classes and I can stop reading without any problem.

And let's come to the point. This is a great game for newcomers in gaming stories. It gives you a nice examples from AAA studios to indie developers. It contains success stories, frustrations, studio collapses and rises. I suggest you to read this book.
