Here is my 2022 recap!</p><h2 id=self-development>Self Development</h2><hr><p>I was reading ton about philosophy but my mind quite blurry. I worry about future, but not in a bad way. I just have a lot of options but I don&rsquo;t know what to do about it.</p><p>As a SWE I improved a lot this year. I switched to a bigger company and started working in a more organized place with lot&rsquo;s of amazing people. I really enjoy being a software engineer!</p><h2 id=what-is-my-goals-in-2023>What is my goal(s) in 2023?</h2><hr><p>I will mention my OKR&rsquo;s here:</p><ul><li>Travel to 5 countries in Europe within the next year.</li><li>Promote to Senior Software Engineer within the next year.</li><li>Increase the subscribers and watch time on my YouTube channel by 150% within the next year.</li><li>Incorporate calisthenics into my daily routine within the next year.</li></ul><p>I tried to be more precise this year. I am not that much hyped for new year like last one :/</p><h2 id=some-topics-for-new-year>Some topics for new year</h2><p>I listed some important topics for me while ending the year.</p><h3 id=1-being-more-focused-and-passionate>1. Being more focused and passionate</h3><hr><p>I put this topic as first because it was the biggest tortue that I carried whole year. Even now I am getting distracted by lot&rsquo;s of stuff.</p><p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t have any solutions except blocking social media to avoid distractions :/</p><h3 id=2-getting-along-with-money-better>2. Getting along with money better</h3><hr><p>I&rsquo;m still young and I feel like I don&rsquo;t know money enough. Even I made ~1k$ from stock market I need to improve myself on this topic.</p><h3 id=3-making-memories-persistent>3. Making memories persistent</h3><hr><p>Human memory is just like iPhone X with 64GB storage. Capacity is low espacially in short term, and I feel this in every moment.</p><p>Writing, taking photos or videos. I need to do them more.</p><h3 id=what-i-did-about-learning-language>What I did about learning language?</h3><hr><p>Here we are, consistent topic of every year, maybe life. I move my focus into Portugese and keep English/Japanese just in same place.</p><h4 id=english>English</h4><p>I made great achivement. Espacially in spoken english.</p><h4 id=japonca>Japonca</h4><p>I just took some courses and learned reading (Hiragana/Katakana), some daily conversations but thats all. Main issue is not finding anyone to speak tbh. It breaks motivation as well.</p><h4 id=portugese>Portugese</h4><p>So here we are, new final boss. I am not interested in language or culture tbh. But I need Portugese to live in Portugal. Simple, isn&rsquo;t it? Also It&rsquo;s makes easy to learn Spanish and Italian.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know anything now, but I want to be able to speak Portugese until 2024.</p><h2 id=gaming>Gaming</h2><hr><ul><li><strong>League of Legends</strong>: Classic, Hell. I didn&rsquo;t played since last month. I&rsquo;m just watching Zeitnot.</li><li><strong>Minecraft</strong>/<strong>World of Tanks</strong>: Fun to spend some time on it, I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t spent too much.</li><li><strong>Rainbow Six Siege</strong>: Not bad while playing with friends, I didn&rsquo;t played by myself at all.</li></ul><hr><footer><section><h4>Share</h4><nav class="nav sharing-icons"><a class=nav-item href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fblog.yusufpapurcu.com%2fpost%2f2022-recap-en%2f" title="Share on Facebook"><span class="fab fa-facebook-f fa-2x" aria-hidden=true></span></a>
